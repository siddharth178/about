Few days back [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) posted an article talking about DNS and small little tool she wrote to learn more on that topic. I really like this idea of creating small tools to learn new things.

I am not a Rust person but I was curious to see what it takes to do similar thing in Go. Another advantage of doing it is, it gives me a chance to peek into mature, capable packet processing library - [gopacket](https://github.com/google/gopacket). Gopacket surely needs lot more exploration to use it properly, but it was easy to learn the basics and put it to use for this small utility.
