* As I continue to read Data Intensive Applications, I wonder why I was so late to pick up this book. Its awesome book - touching many topics at decent depth and explaining things very clearly.
* Re-watching Rich Hickey's [Persistent Data Structures and Managed References](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Identity-State-Rich-Hickey/) helped me think more about different data structures used in databases. Its amazing to see how a very old datastructure B-Trees is still very relevant. But looking at how Rich has implemented persistent immutable data structures, I keep wondering if something can be done to actually make these immutable datastuctures backed by disk. More reading and thinking needed here.
* I watched [EraDB's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfWHw4RemaM) on CMU DB group channel. Things I really found interesting are
  - Possible use of dimentionality to solve cardinality
  - Auto-indexing
  - Using ML to find out patterns in data and store and index them accordingly. This ML technique can also be used to see query patterns and identify possible indexes.
