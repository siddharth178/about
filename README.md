I bought a new laptop, a personal laptop after 15 years. After thinking a lot about which machine should I buy, I settled on Lenovo Legion 5, Ryzen 4600 edition. I was definitely not going to buy a MacbookPro for 2 reasons. Super costly - I know build quality is great but still its way more costly if we compare hardware specs with other options. No or costly product support - if Apple makes any mistakes in their design - e.g. mag-safe connector and its issues with heat, they will support that mistake only for N years. But after that, even if other hardware is in really good condition Apple suggests you to dump that hardware i.e. recycle it and then buy a new one. There are no workarounds provided. Also Apple hardware accessories, adapters, cables are super costly - which doesn't make sense.

Anyway, this new laptop is going to be my work machine. It comes with 8GB RAM and its expandable upto 32GB. So I had ordered another 8GB. Today after so many years I opened a laptop and installed this extra 8GB. It felt nice. I used to be hardware-software person in collage and for some more years after collage. But considering jobs I picked, I moved (got moved) away from hardware. So doing this small hardware upgrade felt specially nice! I knew upgrading RAM is going to be easy considering this is a upgradable gaming machine but [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sZlqqLC8UM) made the handling more confident.

1st laptop I bought was in 2006. Its Compaq v2000 if I am remembering it correctly. It was one of my biger technology spends after I started working in 2002. I think it costed me around Rs.45K for Celeron, 14" screen and 512MB RAM. And my new machine today costed Rs.65K for Ryzen, 256G SSD, 1T HDD, nvidia 4G graphics, FHD, 16G RAM - what a difference! But still I feel Celeron machine from 2006 has better ROI because I am (my father) is still using it even today. It runs Windows, CorelDraw and one CNC software to control a CNC engraving machine. Its battery doesn't really work anymore, but when connected to power it boots up every time and makes the CNC machine do what we want it to do. This machine has seen lots of OSes over the years - in initial years, when I used to experiment a lot with OSes and hardware, I had installed many unixes - NetBSD, OpenBSD, Gentoo, Fedora, Ubuntu on it. There was this project going on in local PLUG to create a distribution of our own. I remember I have successfully installed Plan9 on it. This machine was also the one which I took to present our idea (paahijen + TagWise) to [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) in Nov-Dec of 2006. So lots of memories linked to this machine. Hopefully it will keep running for many more years.
