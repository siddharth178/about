## Hi, I am Siddharth Karandikar
I am experienced software engineer living in Pune, India.

For the past many years, I have been working as backend engineer in large companies and startups. I am a coder and love writing, reading, reviewing code. Programming languages doesn't really matter, but these days I am building things using Golang. In past I have programmed in Java, Python, Ruby, C. Bash scripting and Unix shell has always been there and I think it will stay there for many more years. I love discussing various technology topics, hardware or software and their impact on our day to day life.

I have built software products for various domains. Email and collaboration suite, Reporting and Analytics for Security and Telecom, Management tools for HPC clusters, Data protection, Caching at Telecom Edge, CTV Adtech etc. But if I want to find a theme across all these projects, then it has to be "data". Most of my work has been in the area of data modeling, data protection, data analytics and building infrastructure for handling data.
